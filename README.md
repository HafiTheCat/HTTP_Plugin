# ðŸ‘‹Hi
**HTTP_PLUGIN** was another experiment I did in **2020**.
I attempted to transfer data from a **Spigot** Plugin to an HTTP server, such as *block* and *player* information.
When a block is broken, the `playerID` and `blockMaterial` are sent to an HTTP server at `localhost:4000` via the `POST` `/` route.

# ðŸ“” Usage
This plugin is for Minecraft *1.16.5* and was just an experiment.
Import project with `IntelliJ IDEA` or by other means.
